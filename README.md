## me16b1661a
- consists of `Naive Bayes` implementation using `maximum likelihood` method.
- `Loss matrix` is also used.
- `Bias and Variance` trade-off illustrated by varying `polynomial degree` and `regularizing coefficients` using `Ridge` for an exponential function.
  
## prog-ass-2
- `Logistic Regression` with `kernels` is implemented using `gradient descent` method.
- `SVMs` with various kernels is implemented.
- `Decision tree` is built from scratch.
- `Random Forest` algorithm is implemented.

## prog-ass-3
- `KNN`
- `PCA`
- `Collaborative filtering - baseline method`
- `EM` algorithm for `GMMs`
